All my captured things go here

** TODO Read more about org-mode
SCHEDULED: <2025-02-07 Fri>
I should read more about the efforts, the org-habit, and customise my org-mode a
   little more. I was also thinking on moving my emacs config to be made in
   org-mode, so maybe that's a little more verbose and useful for other people.

I should finish beroot, at least just do the password thingy and start figuring
   out the persistance.
